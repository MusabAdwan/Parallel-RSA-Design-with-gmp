# Parallel-RSA-Design-with-gmp
The RSA algorithm is one of the most famous algorithms in cryptography and its use of modular exponentiation which is computationally intensive made speeding it up the focus of attention for many researchers. This project proposes a detailed design method for developing parallel RSA algorithms using the Open MPI and OpenMP environments
